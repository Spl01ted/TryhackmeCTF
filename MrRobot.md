Navigate to http://MACHINE-IP

Let's check if the site has robots.txt file
<img width="1906" height="585" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 18-59-16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9547fad8-12e7-4fdd-81e3-96554c625d75" />

We find the first key and dictionary, let's download it!

The dict contains many duplicates we can remove that by using this command

```bash
cat fsocity.dic | tee | sort | uniq > pass.txt
```

Let's run gobuster and see what hidden directories site has

<img width="552" height="366" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-06-02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21350ab1-7219-4a3b-9379-1ab7bf5949d7" />

The wp-login is very interesting path, by navigating you can see that this is wordpress login page
<img width="1919" height="895" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-07-21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b93ac37-52b3-4d3e-9b88-cd59a97ef156" />

Now because this room is called "Mr robot CTF" i tried to guess the username based on the characters' names,
by inserting a username and invalid password and "elliot" is valid, otherwise we could to use such tools like hydra or wpscan to brute force the username.

Now we can use wpscan to brute force the password with username "elliot" with dict that we downloaded.

We've successfuly found the valid combination!Let's login.

Now to achieve the RCE here go to appearance > Editor
<img width="1919" height="896" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-22-49" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a7718c6-9ccc-4a19-aa9e-bd84d84b3dfd" />

I will add my template in 404.php and this gonna be the php reverse shell.
If you are using kali it's available in /usr/share/webshells/php path, otherwise you can download this repository https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell.

<img width="320" height="524" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-27-31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e47f3c96-22b9-40b7-b2b7-52c87a93e235" />

Change the ip variable to your ip, and port change to 4444 or you can leave so, then create a netcat listener.
<img width="346" height="81" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-30-05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08699f92-6a44-4b42-bcb1-d7ce7512967c" />

Because we added our exploit in 404.php, we need to trigger the webapp to return us 404 status code to achieve RCE, simply go to the path in app that do not exist.
<img width="1051" height="203" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-33-21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09880e87-1636-415c-95e6-d6fe863fef43" />

The second flag is in /home/robot, but we don't have permission to read it, but we have some interesting file that is containing a md5 hash and it's releated to robot, let's crack it by using Crackstation
<img width="1051" height="677" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-35-05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b061843-7993-4641-b885-2912410bb07a" />
<img width="1063" height="102" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-01 19-38-03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc4c88a-f87e-4d48-96cd-484511e3202b" />

We can change our user to robot by using cracked password and now we can read our file that is containing our second key.

The third key is in /root directory, so we need to escalate our priveleges.
The basic vector is checking the binaries that have SUID set.
The following command will help us

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Then we need to check each binary in GTFObins, and we can use nmap binary to escalate our priveleges

```bash
nmap --interactive
nmap> !sh
```
